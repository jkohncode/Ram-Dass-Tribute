    <p class="bio-p">Ram Dass was an American spiritual teacher and psychedelic pioneer. He was born Richard Alpert to a wealthy family, including his father who was the president of the New Haven Railroad Company and first chairman of Brandeis University. Richard Alpert became Ram Dass after a trip to India to discover the maps for consciousness, where he then met an Indian guru named Neem Karoli Baba(otherwise known as Maharaji). Neem Karoli Baba gave Richard the name Ram Dass to signify his transformation. Ram is the hindi word for God, and Dass is Hindi for servant, therefore making his name translate to servant of God. 
        Ram Dass along with Larry Brilliant and Wavy Gravy founded the Seva Foundation, a charitable organization that seeks to cure blindness in the developing world. Their work and contributions to the Seva Foundation, were aimed specifically at medical attention to people with eye problems in Nepal, India and other southeast asian countries.

    <p class="sec-bio-p">After his trip to India and subsequent spiritual awakening, Ram Dass became a prolific public speaker. Mostly traveling through the continental United States, he would be invited to give lectures on anything ranging from pyschological stages of humans, to the dissolution of the ego through the use of psychedelics. Ram Dass would often go to extremes in regards to confronting the essential truths about life, including spending extended periods of time with people dying from AIDS, or other fatal diseases. He wanted to know the truth as it relates to death. The only way he thought he could do this authentically, was to confront death head on and not shy away from this reality. Ram Dass helped others become awake, much in the same way he awoke under Neem Karoli Baba. Ram Dass effectively popularized mindfulness and eastern practices to a western audience. Towards old age, Ram Dass experienced a stroke and was not able to speak for an extended period. He experienced trouble walking, and was confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. However dire this predicament was, Ram Dass came to the conclusion that the stroke was the grace of his guru Neem Karoli Baba. Ram Dass was able to experience a level of peace, he had not before experienced. The stroke taught him patience, and the ability to more fully appreciate the time he had left. Ram Dass passed away on December 22, 2019 and will be forever missed.</p>
